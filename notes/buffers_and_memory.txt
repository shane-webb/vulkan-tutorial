At the end of the Vertex Buffers chapter:

    // NOTE: "The previous chapter already mentioned that you should allocate multiple resources like buffers from a single memory allocation,
    // but in fact you should go a step further. Driver developers recommend that you also store multiple buffers, like the vertex and index buffer,
    // into a single VkBuffer and use offsets in commands like vkCmdBindVertexBuffers. The advantage is that your data is more cache friendly in that case,
    // because it's closer together. It is even possible to reuse the same chunk of memory for multiple resources if they are not used during the same render operations,
    // provided that their data is refreshed, of course. This is known as aliasing and some Vulkan functions have explicit flags to specify that you want to do this."
